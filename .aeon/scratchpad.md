# Human in the Loop Scratchpad

This file contains notes, decisions, and observations during development.

## Bootstrap Notes (2025-08-04)

- Starting project setup with modular-by-feature architecture
- Using TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier with sensible defaults
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, testing with Vitest, Playwright, Storybook
- UI with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN components
- Backend ready for Supabase integration

## Open Questions

- [ ] Project name and package name to use?
- [ ] Primary domain/URL for deployment?
- [ ] Supabase project URL and keys?
- [ ] Any specific feature priorities beyond example setup?

## Important Notes

- GitHub Actions workflow files need to be created manually due to permission restrictions
- The CI/CD workflows are documented but not included in this commit
- See `/docs/decisions/0002-quality-gates.md` for the intended CI setup
